  <h2>Ancient Palace</h2>
  <p>Carcosa is a large ruined city near the southern coast of Lemuria. In the center is a palace in almost pristine condition, the tallest spire of which is built directly where, during the earth's rotation, the star of Aldebaran is directly above at exactly one time in the year.</p>

<p>This palace, known to residents as the Ancient Palace, is full of strange and wonderful sights. Feel free to stop by. (<a href="../../legal.html">See the legal page</a>)</p>
  <h2>
    Pallid Mask Theatre Shoppe</h2>
  <p>The Pallid Mask Theatre Shoppe is your one-stop shop for costuming needs. If you need cloaks, we got it. Period clothing that looks like it was ripped through time to this spot? We got it. Masks that are blank and fuse to not only your body but your mind and soul as well? We got it. Found at the corner of Phantom Ave. & Truth Ln.</p>
  <h2>The Black Star Eatery</h2>
  <p>Strange is the night where black stars rise, and twin moons circle through the skies, but stranger still are the prices at the Black Star Eatery. Come in for a spell (literally), and taste the best food on all of Lemuria.</p>
