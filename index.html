  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning1">
    You probably should not be here. Leave now, traveler.</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning2">
    Maybe you should just step in, buy some merchandise, and go home and say you did stuff.</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning3">
    You might be able to venture beyond the gift shop, but not very far. Maybe check out the cities, and not the ancient ones; the modern ones. Suggestions: Arkham, Innsmouth.</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning4">
    You're pretty brave. You can explore Arkham and Innsmouth's hidden secrets.</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning5">
    Explore the depths of Arkham and Innsmouth, but take note also of Yuggoth.</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning6">
    Most of the cities are probably a good choice to be explored, though don't get lost in Yuggoth or Hyperborea.</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning7">
  Congratulations! You are sufficiently corageous enough that you have been selected for a special tour of Carcosa. Downloading directly into your brain right now should be a memory of events long past, including a tour through the palace of Carcosa! What an event!</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning8">
    Not content to explore Carcosa in your mind, you might want to try exploring it in real life!</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning9">
    Visit the pristine landscape of R'lyeh, and visit the great Temple inside.</p>
  <p class="dangerwarning" id="dangerwarning10">
    Fight Cthulhu!</p>

    <p>Lemuria is a small island off of the West North American coast, discovered by the famed explorer Howard Philips.</p>
    <p>Long thought but a legend, the island was uninhabited; however, there were the ruins of a great civilization on its surface. Scraps of ancient texts named these cities, and other more modern cities were built near them.</p>
