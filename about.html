    <h2>What is Unknown</h2>
    <p>No one knows how long ago the first settlements were made on Lemuria. All efforts to carbon-date fossil remains have lead to nothing but broken machines and broken minds.</p>
    <h2>What is Known</h2>
    <p>The isle of Lemuria was discovered in 1915 by Howard Philips, an American explorer from Providence, Rhode Island. He was in the pacific on a routine trip to the jungles in the east when his ship was caught in a storm. When the sky cleared, he saw land in the distance. He set foot upon the shore, and saw massive castles and temples in the distance. Despite searching for several days, no evidence of current human habitation was found, so he claimed the isle. Eventually settlers on the island declared independance.</p>
