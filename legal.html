  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The nation of Lemuria does not take responsibility for any consequences of exploring the palace of Carcosa, which may include but are not limited to: Gazing upon the Yellow King, being eaten by a Boneless Horror, being picked up by a byakhee, or becoming stuck in a timeloop inside the main palace ballroom for all eternity.</p>
  <p>The nation of Lemuria is not responsible for locating your loved one's remains after they have been devoured alive by Great Cthulhu, nor are they liable for your loved ones being snatched by the colossal arm and being pulled into the depths of the abyss.</p>
</div>
<div class="Other Information">
  <h2>Other Information</h2>
  <p>The nation of Lemuria is not subject to your pitiful mortal laws, and therefore all visitors must do the following upon entering:
    <ul>
      <li>Foreswear any notion that this country is like a permanent <i>The Purge</i>;</li>
      <li>Get your passport stamped with the official <i>Cthulhu Approves Quality Certificate</i> stamp;</li>
      <li>Drop down to your knees and praise the Great Old Ones;</li>
      <li>And finally, purchase at least one (1) piece of quality merchandise from the official Lemuria Tourism Board Tourist Shop.</li>
  </ul>
  Once you do all these things, you will be permitted entrance into lemuria. Fail to do so, and you will be left to swim back to your country of origin.</p>
