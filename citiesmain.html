    <h1>Cities of Lemuria</h1>
    <p>Lemuria has many cities. Some of them are the ancient cities discovered by the first explorers. Some are more modern. Almost all are crawling with seemingly unearthly horrors. So stop by some of our most famous:</p>
  </div>
  <div class='smallsection'>
    <h2>Carcosa</h2>
    <button onclick="expand1()">Show/Hide Information</button>
    <div id="expandable1" class="expandable">
    <p>Carcosa is a large ruined city near the southern coast of Lemuria. In the center is a palace in almost pristine condition, the tallest spire of which is built directly where, during the earth's rotation, the star of Aldebaran is directly above at exactly one time in the year.</p>
    <p>This palace, known to residents as the Ancient Palace, is full of strange and wonderful sights. Feel free to stop by.*</p>
    <p>For more attractions, please visit the Carcosa homepage.</p>
  
    <div class='disclaimer'>*Disclaimer: the nation of Lemuria does not take responsibility for any consequences of exploring the palace, which may include but are not limited to: Gazing upon the Yellow King, being eaten by a Boneless Horror, being picked up by a byakhee, or becoming stuck in a timeloop inside the main palace ballroom for all eternity.</div>
  </div>

  <div class='smallsection'>
    <h2>Râ€™lyeh</h2>
    <button onclick="expand2()">Show/Hide Information</button>
    <div class="expandable" id="expandable2">
    <p>R'lyeh is a city that is located at the bottom of the lake of Hali, to the east of Carcosa. However, the Lemuria Tourism Initiative has helpfully provided transport to the city, free of charge, and has constructed an airtight bubble around the city so that you can actually go inside.</p>
    <p>The largest and most noticable attraction in R'lyeh is the Ancient Temple. It is a temple to some forgotten god now known only as "Cthulhu." However, the god is forgotten but not gone (<i>that is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange aeons even death may die</i>), and every 66.6 hours, a random lucky visitor is chosen to be feasted upon by Great Cthulhu. It is a great honor*, so if you or a loved one is chosen, take a moment to drop to your knees and praise the all-mighty Cthulhu.</p>
    <p>For more attractions, please visit the R'lyeh homepage.
  <div class="disclaimer">
    *Disclaimer: the nation of Lemuria is not responsible for locating your loved one's remains after they have been devoured alive by Great Cthulhu, nor are they liable for your loved ones being snatched by the colossal arm and being pulled into the depths of the abyss.</div>

  <div class="smallsection">
    <h2>Innsmouth</h2>
